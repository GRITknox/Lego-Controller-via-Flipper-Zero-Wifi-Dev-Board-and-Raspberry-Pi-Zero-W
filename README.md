# Lego-Controller-via-Flipper-Zero-Wifi-Dev-Board-and-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-W
This is for the D11 Lego Bulldozer, but should work for any with proper formatting.

This can be done without the Flipper Zero WiFi dev board.  You would need to purchase a 433 MHz RF module and pair it with any Pi or Arduino type device.

Doing this one on the pico w with Micro Python.  

This is my first attempt at posting a build on github and specifics of the code will be cleaned up.
